- Recency: How recent was the customers last purchase? 
- Frequency: How often did the customer work with us in the selected period?
- Monetary: How much money did the customer spend in a given period? 

### Background

- Our questions: Who are our customers? How can we leverage our data?
- The RFM groups were then used to market to each individual group.
